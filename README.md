## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! I am a junior data analyst with a passion for turning raw data into meaningful insights. My experience spans using tools like Excel and SQL to analyze and organize data, helping businesses make data-driven decisions. Iâ€™m also expanding my skill set by learning Python, with a focus on automating data cleaning and reporting tasks to streamline workflows and improve efficiency.

Excel has been my go-to tool for data manipulation, where Iâ€™ve created complex formulas, pivot tables, and charts to analyze and visualize data. SQL has allowed me to work with databases, run queries, and extract the precise information needed for analysis. These tools have provided a strong foundation for my data analysis work, enabling me to efficiently clean, analyze, and report on datasets.

As I continue to learn Python, I am increasingly using it to automate repetitive tasks, such as data wrangling, cleaning, and generating reports. Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy have opened up new possibilities for processing and analyzing large datasets, and Iâ€™m excited to explore how these tools can further enhance my workflow and allow me to tackle more complex analytical challenges.

In this repository, you will find various projects that showcase my work in data analysis, including code for data cleaning, SQL queries, and simple Python scripts for automating analysis tasks. I am always eager to learn and grow, and I hope these projects can provide value to others in the data analysis community. Feel free to explore, contribute, or reach out if youâ€™d like to connect or collaborate on any of these projects!
